# Interactive Physics Olio

## Project purpose

This repository contains rigorous interactive visualizations of
physical and mathematical concepts.

The primary goal is conceptual clarity and physical correctness.
Visual appeal is important, but must never override correctness.

## Repository architecture

- `workbench/`
  - local exploratory work
  - unrestricted
  - not publication quality
  - normally ignored by git
  - exploratory work here does not require or justify creating a branch; create a feature branch
    only when promoting selected work into tracked publication source

- `visualizations/`
  - publication-quality visualization source code

- `docs/`
  - English public-facing explanatory material and shared site assets

- `docs_ja/`
  - Japanese counterparts of every public page in `docs/`

- `src/physics_atlas/`
  - shared infrastructure and utilities

- generated site files must never be manually edited

## Development rules

1. Keep physics calculations separate from visualization/UI code.
2. Physics logic belongs in `physics.py`.
3. Rendering and interaction belong in `visualization.py`.
4. Add tests for meaningful physical or mathematical invariants.
5. Do not duplicate physical formulas across UI code when they can
   be called from the physics layer.
6. Prefer simple implementations over unnecessary framework complexity.
7. Prefer static browser-native outputs when possible.
8. Do not introduce a server dependency for published visualizations
   without an explicit architectural decision.
9. Do not modify unrelated visualizations when implementing one feature.
10. Published content supports English (`en`) and Japanese (`ja`). Every public page and
    every user-facing string must be available in both languages.
11. The site brand is always `Interactive Physics Olio`. It links to the home page for
    the current language and is displayed without a separate logo icon.
12. Language switches must point to the corresponding page, not merely the other-language
    home page.
13. Translation must never change a physical equation, mathematical convention, numerical
    result, or plot data.
14. Published applications are supported over HTTP/HTTPS. Use a loopback HTTP server for local
    browser QA; direct `file://` viewing is unsupported and must not drive alternate loaders,
    wildcard messaging, or browser-specific fallback paths.
15. A published visualization may either be embedded in an explanatory article or be a standalone
    application linked directly from a field index. Standalone applications do not require a
    duplicate article, but their listing summary must state what readers can do.

## Bilingual content policy

- English pages live under `docs/`; Japanese pages live at the same relative paths under
  `docs_ja/`. Add or revise both languages in the same change.
- Keep section structure, equations, links, visualization embeds, and scientific scope aligned
  across languages. Translation must not create a second scientific or figure-data variant.
- Localize every user-facing control, instruction, status, error, and accessibility label.
  Plot-internal text—including axes, legends, hover text, and Plotly controls—remains English in
  both languages so a single figure payload can be shared.
- `Interactive Physics Olio` is the untranslated site brand and home link. Do not place a logo
  icon beside it. Page headings and visualization UI titles may be localized.
- Write natural technical Japanese rather than translating English syntax mechanically. For
  short summaries and card descriptions, prefer concise noun-ending phrases when natural; avoid
  repeatedly ending descriptions with `を対話的に探究します。`.
- Use `インタラクティブ`, not `対話的`, when that adjective is needed.
- Use these established section names consistently:
  - Relativity: `相対論`
  - Quantum Field Theory: `場の量子論`
  - Mathematics for Physics: `物理数学`
- When a listing contains both a title and a description, render them as distinct lines with the
  same left edge. Do not simulate the line break with trailing spaces or encoded whitespace.

## Mathematical typography policy

- Mathematical notation in prose or application UI must be authored as LaTeX and rendered as
  mathematics. Raw LaTeX commands must not be exposed to readers.
- Reserve code formatting for literal commands, file names, identifiers, and genuinely code-like
  input. A Lie type, weight, matrix, equation, or mathematical variable is normally mathematics,
  not code.
- Translation must preserve the exact equation, convention, indices, symbols, and numerical
  result. Only surrounding prose may change.
- Follow the more specific rendering rules in `docs/AGENTS.md` and
  `visualizations/AGENTS.md` when editing those trees.

## Validation

During iteration, run only the checks relevant to the articles, visualizations, and tests being
changed. Do not repeatedly run the complete repository suite after each edit.

Once the work is ready for completion, run `uv run python scripts/check.py --all --quiet`. It runs
the required repository-wide lint, format, test, metadata, and site-build checks while retaining
full logs under ignored build output. All checks must pass. If a failure requires another edit,
rerun the relevant targeted check first, then run the completion check again.

## Physics policy

A visualization should test physically meaningful invariants whenever
possible.

Examples include:

- wavefunction normalization
- orthogonality
- conserved quantities
- known limiting behavior
- symmetry relations
- Lie-algebra root/weight identities
- embedding constraints
- unitarity relations

Never change an equation or physical convention merely to improve
the visual appearance.

If a convention is ambiguous, document the convention explicitly.

## Git policy

- `main` must remain publishable.
- Nontrivial work should be done on a feature branch.
- Do not create or switch branches merely for exploratory work confined to the ignored
  `workbench/` tree.
- Do not commit generated site output.


## Documentation audience

Keep public-facing READMEs focused on the project, published URL, user instructions, limitations, and licensing. Put maintainer-only setup, deployment, analytics administration, implementation details, and validation procedures in the dedicated documents below. Keep personal machine paths and temporary work notes out of committed documentation. READMEs inside developer-only directories may serve as technical indexes.
